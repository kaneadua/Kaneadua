# Leaf PHP

[![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/leafs/leaf/downloads)](https://packagist.org/packages/leafs/leaf)

Leaf is a PHP framework that helps you create clean, simple but powerful web apps and APIs quickly and easily. Leaf introduces a cleaner and much simpler structure to the PHP language while maintaining it's flexibility. With a simple structure and a shallow learning curve, it's an excellent way to rapidly build powerful and high performant web apps and APIs.

## Installation

You can easily install Leaf using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require leafs/leaf
```

This will install Leaf in your project directory.

## Basic Usage

This is a simple demonstration of Leaf's simplicity.
After [installing](#installation) Leaf, create an _index.php_ file.

```php
<?php
require __DIR__ . 'vendor/autoload.php';

$app = new Leaf\App;
$auth = new Leaf\Auth;

$auth->connect("host", "user", "pass", "db name");

// Base example
$app->get('/', function() use($app) {
   $app->response()->respond("My first Leaf app");
});

// Full login example
$app->post('/auth/login', function() use($app, $auth) {
    $credentials = $app->request()->get(["username", "password"]);

    $user = $auth->login("users", $credentials, [
        "username" => ["username", "max:15"],
        "password" => ["text", "NoSpaces", "min:8"],
    ]);

    if (!$user) {
        $app->response()->throwErr($auth->errors());
    }

    $app->response()->json($user);
});

$app->run();
```

You may quickly test this using the built-in PHP server:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

## Working With MVC

Leaf has recently added a new package to it's collection: LeafMVC.
It's an MVC framework built with this package at it's core that let's you create clean, simple but powerful web applications and APIs quickly and easily.

Checkout LeafMVC [here](https://github.com/leafsphp/leafMVC)

## Working with API

Leaf also added a simple framework constructed in an MVCish way, but without the View layer purposely for creating APIs and Libraries. Leaf terms this construct as MRRC(Model Request Response ControllerüòÖüòÖüòÖ). This let's you seperate API logic, data and "views"(request and response) just like how it's done in MVC.

Checkout the LeafAPI package [here](https://github.com/leafsphp/leafAPI)

## Skeleton

Skeleton is the latest package included in the Leaf family. Skeleton is a customizable and simple to use boilerplate powered by Leaf. Skeleton gives you the power of other setups like Leaf MVC without the restrictions of those full blown frameworks. [Use and contribute](https://github.com/leafsphp/skeleton) to Skeleton

Of course, with this core package, you can build your app in any way that you wish to as Leaf contains all the required functionality to do so
